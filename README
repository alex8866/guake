Guake with alt+num goto specific tab 

After trying out Guake terminal, I found my self in need of an alt+num goto-tab shortcut. 
Searching for it, I found here somebody making a patch to do that, but it was based on an 
older version of guake (0.4.2). So here's the corrected patch for the 0.4.4 version. 
No need to recompile, as the guake bin is actually a python file.

Installation:
1. Install guake (apt-get, yum, emerge ...)
2. Patch:
    cat modify.patch | sudo patch -p3 -b -d /usr/bin
    

guake-0.4.4: Unmodified source code.
